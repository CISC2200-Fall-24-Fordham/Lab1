In this first lab assignment, we setup our **programming environment**, **modify given code**,
and **practice submitting to autograder system**.


## Programming Environment Setup
We will set up programming environment our our own computer, by following [Setup Tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). 

- The _Commannd Line Tools_ are required. 

- The _C++ Dev Environment_ (VSCode) is highly recommened.

**Please follow these tutorials closely and carefully.**

A code skeleton is given for this lab. You are asked to finish the following, test and run the program:

1. Implement the IntArray class's constructor
2. Implement the desstructor 
3. Implement the reverse member function
